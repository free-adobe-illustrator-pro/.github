# Adobe Illustrator
When you get Adobe Illustrator CC for Windows, you're equipping yourself with the most advanced vector editing tools available. Vector graphics are resolution-independent, meaning your work can scale from business cards to billboards without losing quality. This makes Illustrator essential for logo design, typography, brand identities, product packaging, infographics, and even web or app UI layouts.

Illustrator’s intuitive drawing tools, like the Pen Tool and Curvature Tool, allow you to craft detailed paths with precision. Shape-building tools, alignment controls, snapping guides, and live previewing features streamline the design process for both beginners and experienced designers alike.

## Seamless workflow with Creative Cloud
As part of the Adobe Creative Cloud suite, Illustrator CC integrates directly with apps like Photoshop, After Effects, and InDesign. You can easily drag and drop Illustrator files into other programs, preserve vector layers, and even animate designs in After Effects without losing quality. This integration saves time and simplifies project management across teams.

Files can be saved to the cloud for access across multiple devices, and real-time collaboration features allow clients or coworkers to view and comment on work from anywhere.
## Key Features
- Advanced vector editing
Powerful tools like the Pen, Pencil, and Shape Builder allow you to create, modify, and combine paths and shapes with pinpoint accuracy. Illustrator supports precise anchor point control, curve manipulation, and custom shape logic.

- Artboards and multipage layouts
You can work on different designs in a single document by using multiple artboards. Great for social media kits, app mockups, or print layouts, artboards can be exported individually or as a batch.

Illustrator supports CMYK, RGB, Pantone, and spot color workflows. You can manage swatches, apply freeform gradients, build color themes, and use global colors for consistent branding across designs.
